"After the emotional turmoil that was Endgame, this movie expands upon the idea of \"what happens now?\". The tone of the movie is lighthearted but has some deep moments, making the viewer laugh and cry. Gorgeous visuals and a great script complement the perfectly casted actors. However, some tension gets removed quickly by cheap jokes and predictability."

"I really, really, REALLY enjoyed this movie. Tom Holland continues to do a spectacular job as Peter Parker/Spider-Man. Jacob Batalon continues to be the funny best friend that always has Peter's back throughout their trip far from home. Zendaya is great as MJ and it was nice to see more of her in this movie than from Homecoming. Samuel L Jackson always does an amazing job whenever he appears as Nick Fury, and him teaming up with Spider-Man was awesome (with lots of funny moments). John Favreau made Happy Hogan become one of my favorite side characters after the movie ended. Also, Jake Gyllenhaal simply KILLED IT as Mysterio. His performance was phenomenal; add all the CGI to it and my mind was blown out the roof! I give Spider-Man Far From Home a 10/10. Can the next Spider-Man movie come out already???"

"Just watched this film in the cinema today and wow. I am happy to say that this film exceeded my expectations massively as it was crammed with incredible action sequences, visual effects and comedy it was hilarious, emursive and just absolutely insane. Not your typical superhero plot and it works brilliantly with twists and unexpected fantastic moments that will surprise all viewers I would have to say this film is certainly one of the best live action Spiderman films I've seen. In fact this one is definitely my favourite. My ranking - Superb."

The tone of the movie is lighthearted but has some deep moments, making the viewer laugh and cry. Gorgeous visuals and a great script complement the perfectly casted actors.

"I really, really, REALLY enjoyed this movie. Tom Holland continues to do a spectacular job as Peter Parker/Spider-Man. Jacob Batalon continues to be the funny best friend that always has Peter's back throughout their trip far from home. Zendaya is great as MJ and it was nice to see more of her in this movie than from Homecoming. Samuel L Jackson always does an amazing job whenever he appears as Nick Fury, and him teaming up with Spider-Man was awesome (with lots of funny moments). John Favreau made Happy Hogan become one of my favorite side characters after the movie ended. Also, Jake Gyllenhaal simply KILLED IT as Mysterio. His performance was phenomenal; add all the CGI to it and my mind was blown out the roof! I give Spider-Man Far From Home a 10/10. Can the next Spider-Man movie come out already???"

"Just watched this film in the cinema today and wow. I am happy to say that this film exceeded my expectations massively as it was crammed with incredible action sequences, visual effects and comedy it was hilarious, emursive and just absolutely insane. Not your typical superhero plot and it works brilliantly with twists and unexpected fantastic moments that will surprise all viewers I would have to say this film is certainly one of the best live action Spiderman films I've seen. In fact this one is definitely my favourite. My ranking - Superb."

It was kind of obvious that Mysterio couldn't be a good guy, but I liked how they did the twist.
Definetly go watch it!"
"Best Spiderman movie yet! It has great movement, progression, effects, lots of humor and irony coming from the 16 year old stars perspective. Not sure what the 1 star crack pots were hoping for because this film was amazing and a great follow up release to Avengers: Endgame!"

"After the emotional turmoil that was Endgame, this movie expands upon the idea of \"what happens now?\". The tone of the movie is lighthearted but has some deep moments, making the viewer laugh and cry. Gorgeous visuals and a great script complement the perfectly casted actors. However, some tension gets removed quickly by cheap jokes and predictability."

"I really, really, REALLY enjoyed this movie. Tom Holland continues to do a spectacular job as Peter Parker/Spider-Man. Jacob Batalon continues to be the funny best friend that always has Peter's back throughout their trip far from home. Zendaya is great as MJ and it was nice to see more of her in this movie than from Homecoming. Samuel L Jackson always does an amazing job whenever he appears as Nick Fury, and him teaming up with Spider-Man was awesome (with lots of funny moments). John Favreau made Happy Hogan become one of my favorite side characters after the movie ended. Also, Jake Gyllenhaal simply KILLED IT as Mysterio. His performance was phenomenal; add all the CGI to it and my mind was blown out the roof! I give Spider-Man Far From Home a 10/10. Can the next Spider-Man movie come out already???"

"Just watched this film in the cinema today and wow. I am happy to say that this film exceeded my expectations massively as it was crammed with incredible action sequences, visual effects and comedy it was hilarious, emursive and just absolutely insane. Not your typical superhero plot and it works brilliantly with twists and unexpected fantastic moments that will surprise all viewers I would have to say this film is certainly one of the best live action Spiderman films I've seen. In fact this one is definitely my favourite. My ranking - Superb."
