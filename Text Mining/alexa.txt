    This is very good hardware and speaker. However very much handicapped by amazon on software front. It can not understand your commands 70-80 percentage times and very limited to amazon music and saavn. However you can not use any of good music apps like wynk, gaana, youtube etc.Also natural language processing is supported in google products but not in this echo.For example when you say-1) where is agra - it gives you correct answer.2) continue with next query like how to reach there ?Then for 2nd query it doesn't know what to do..This is just an example but most of the times you will find this issue there.Then you can not connect with other populer music etc apps. Have to rely on what amazon thinks os good for you.Amazon music has very limited music base.So looking forward to get more access and integration with alexa however not have much hope since its already such an old plateform that they would have given support if there were any such plans.

    It definitely has better speakers than Eco Dot Gen2 and Google Home Mini, but sound recognition is very poor compared to Google Home Mini or even previous Eco Dot. Maybe it has something to do with cost cutting and Amazon going with only 4 far field microphones instead of 7.But due to it's poor recognition, it takes a lot of time, sometimes even minutes and does nothing... Which definitely takes away the experience. Unfortunately I can't return it... But I think Google Home Mini is miles ahead and better with all the new updates to Google Assistant (Sleep assist and stuff).Update as on 27th April 2019: Software has gone from bad to worst. It plays certain songs again and again, doesn't let you skip. Recognition has also gone from bad to worst, you have to yell for Alexa to understand what you want it to do only for it to tell you it doesn't understand what you said. And expect no support from Amazon about eco devices, it's very bad.

    This was launched on 11th and I got the product by 12th. Plus the reduced price due to sale and a nice smart bulb for just 500 rupees. Overall I think this was super value for money. I haven't used any other smart speaker before but I am very happy with my purchase. Below are some observations :1. Initially it feels a bit weird talking to a speaker but you get used to it in no time.2. The sound quality is pretty good. You get good depth of sound with decent bass.3. Several skills available and you will definitely find some very useful. For example adding stuff to shopping list or setting up a reminder.4. Understands the Indian accent very well. Sometimes I am amazed by how well it picks up stuff.6. Kids love it. An added advantage is that they can take help for homework and talking to alexa also motivates them to talk in English

    Worst software!!! Not even 50% of answers were matched to my questions. Ask anything, it says I'm not sure about that. Not even songs are playing as per my command. After every song it stops. It's not going to the next one. For every command we need to say Alexa. Only advantage with this product is it have a great bass. Waste of money.I asked about today's news and it has the same answer - Sorry, I don't know about what you are asking.OK Google is far far far better than Alexa.Wanna share one funny moment with Alexa...I asked her to tell me about routers and switches and she started telling about sandwich... <U+0001F635>

    At first i was confused which one to buy-Google home mini or Echo dot.After considering few factors I decided to buy this echo dot 3rd gen.Pros:1)Sound quality and volume has improved a lot from previous gen.2)Alexa and Amazon services are more integrated with Indian market which the Google lacks.For example I can book uber cab,order food in zomato,order things from Amazon without even taking out my smartphone.3)It can used as a smart speaker,Bluetooth speaker and also it has 3.5 mm headphone jack.4)Amazon prime membership at Rs 999 per year is the most value for money subscription.You can stream in Amazon prime video,music from prime music,become an Amazon prime member,free kindle e books and many more.Google takes monthly Rs 99 for songs only.5)You can control smart lights and electronics from Philips,Xiaomi,Yeelight and other Alexa compatible devicesCons:1) Let me be honest,Alexa can never beat Google assistant,Never(That's why I gave 4 stars)2)It has to be kept plugged in all the time,not battery powered(same is the case with Google home)So if you are looking for a smarter assistant to interact with,Google home is your choice.For all other uses Amazon echo speakers are better.

    I got it on sale for 3k. For the price, it offers decent sound and richer bass, compared to my much cheaper, 1.5k Bluetooth speaker, the Boat Stone 260. It works seemlessly with my smart home devices, and the app is fantastic. It yet doesn't have support with fire TV stick, but Amazon assures it'll arrive by mid-november, so that's something to look out for. The app works great, and you can control your smart home or this dot from anywhere in the world, as long both of your devices have an internet connection. It's a fun little party trick, really. I couldn't be more happier with my echo dot. Also, as you can see in the picture, I got the sophisticated looking white color ;)Edit: It has fire TV support now, it's not the best experience, but hey - it WORKS.

    Rate of speech cannot be altered. Specially in bedtime stories. Children don't understand the fast English.Accent is pathetic.Kids can't understand the accent.It's a good music player but poor assistant.Many a times the MIC doesn work.The biggest problem is the search. criteria.  There is a lot of information which is on google that it deliberately does not pick.  It searches only from amazon search engine/wikipedia.

    This device does not have integration with Fire TV in INDIA ONLY !!.  So, if you don't have smart plug and smart switches then only thing you can do with this device is play music. not worth paying 3000 for getting voice command support for playing music only.

    At first i was confused which one to buy-Google home mini or Echo dot.After considering few factors I decided to buy this echo dot 3rd gen.Pros:1)Sound quality and volume has improved a lot from previous gen.2)Alexa and Amazon services are more integrated with Indian market which the Google lacks.For example I can book uber cab,order food in zomato,order things from Amazon without even taking out my smartphone.3)It can used as a smart speaker,Bluetooth speaker and also it has 3.5 mm headphone jack.4)Amazon prime membership at Rs 999 per year is the most value for money subscription.You can stream in Amazon prime video,music from prime music,become an Amazon prime member,free kindle e books and many more.Google takes monthly Rs 99 for songs only.5)You can control smart lights and electronics from Philips,Xiaomi,Yeelight and other Alexa compatible devicesCons:1) Let me be honest,Alexa can never beat Google assistant,Never(That's why I gave 4 stars)2)It has to be kept plugged in all the time,not battery powered(same is the case with Google home)So if you are looking for a smarter assistant to interact with,Google home is your choice.For all other uses Amazon echo speakers are better.

    I got it on sale for 3k. For the price, it offers decent sound and richer bass, compared to my much cheaper, 1.5k Bluetooth speaker, the Boat Stone 260. It works seemlessly with my smart home devices, and the app is fantastic. It yet doesn't have support with fire TV stick, but Amazon assures it'll arrive by mid-november, so that's something to look out for. The app works great, and you can control your smart home or this dot from anywhere in the world, as long both of your devices have an internet connection. It's a fun little party trick, really. I couldn't be more happier with my echo dot. Also, as you can see in the picture, I got the sophisticated looking white color ;)Edit: It has fire TV support now, it's not the best experience, but hey - it WORKS.

    Rate of speech cannot be altered. Specially in bedtime stories. Children don't understand the fast English.Accent is pathetic.Kids can't understand the accent.It's a good music player but poor assistant.Many a times the MIC doesn work.The biggest problem is the search. criteria.  There is a lot of information which is on google that it deliberately does not pick.  It searches only from amazon search engine/wikipedia.

    This device does not have integration with Fire TV in INDIA ONLY !!.  So, if you don't have smart plug and smart switches then only thing you can do with this device is play music. not worth paying 3000 for getting voice command support for playing music only.

    This is very good hardware and speaker. However very much handicapped by amazon on software front. It can not understand your commands 70-80 percentage times and very limited to amazon music and saavn. However you can not use any of good music apps like wynk, gaana, youtube etc.Also natural language processing is supported in google products but not in this echo.For example when you say-1) where is agra - it gives you correct answer.2) continue with next query like how to reach there ?Then for 2nd query it doesn't know what to do..This is just an example but most of the times you will find this issue there.Then you can not connect with other populer music etc apps. Have to rely on what amazon thinks os good for you.Amazon music has very limited music base.So looking forward to get more access and integration with alexa however not have much hope since its already such an old plateform that they would have given support if there were any such plans.

    It definitely has better speakers than Eco Dot Gen2 and Google Home Mini, but sound recognition is very poor compared to Google Home Mini or even previous Eco Dot. Maybe it has something to do with cost cutting and Amazon going with only 4 far field microphones instead of 7.But due to it's poor recognition, it takes a lot of time, sometimes even minutes and does nothing... Which definitely takes away the experience. Unfortunately I can't return it... But I think Google Home Mini is miles ahead and better with all the new updates to Google Assistant (Sleep assist and stuff).Update as on 27th April 2019: Software has gone from bad to worst. It plays certain songs again and again, doesn't let you skip. Recognition has also gone from bad to worst, you have to yell for Alexa to understand what you want it to do only for it to tell you it doesn't understand what you said. And expect no support from Amazon about eco devices, it's very bad.

    This was launched on 11th and I got the product by 12th. Plus the reduced price due to sale and a nice smart bulb for just 500 rupees. Overall I think this was super value for money. I haven't used any other smart speaker before but I am very happy with my purchase. Below are some observations :1. Initially it feels a bit weird talking to a speaker but you get used to it in no time.2. The sound quality is pretty good. You get good depth of sound with decent bass.3. Several skills available and you will definitely find some very useful. For example adding stuff to shopping list or setting up a reminder.4. Understands the Indian accent very well. Sometimes I am amazed by how well it picks up stuff.6. Kids love it. An added advantage is that they can take help for homework and talking to alexa also motivates them to talk in English

    Worst software!!! Not even 50% of answers were matched to my questions. Ask anything, it says I'm not sure about that. Not even songs are playing as per my command. After every song it stops. It's not going to the next one. For every command we need to say Alexa. Only advantage with this product is it have a great bass. Waste of money.I asked about today's news and it has the same answer - Sorry, I don't know about what you are asking.OK Google is far far far better than Alexa.Wanna share one funny moment with Alexa...I asked her to tell me about routers and switches and she started telling about sandwich... <U+0001F635>

Maybe it has something to do with cost cutting and Amazon going with only 4 far field microphones instead of 7.But due to it's poor recognition, it takes a lot of time, sometimes even minutes and does nothing... Which definitely takes away the experience. Unfortunately I can't return it... But I think Google Home Mini is miles ahead and better with all the new updates to Google Assistant (Sleep assist and stuff).Update as on 27th April 2019: Software has gone from bad to worst. It plays certain songs again and again, doesn't let you skip. Recognition has also gone from bad to worst, you have to yell for Alexa to understand what you want it to do only for it to tell you it doesn't understand what you said. And expect no support from Amazon about eco devices, it's very bad.

    This was launched on 11th and I got the product by 12th. Plus the reduced price due to sale and a nice smart bulb for just 500 rupees. Overall I think this was super value for money. I haven't used any other smart speaker before but I am very happy with my purchase. Below are some observations :1. Initially it feels a bit weird talking to a speaker but you get used to it in no time.2. The sound quality is pretty good. You get good depth of sound with decent bass.3. Several skills available and you will definitely find some very useful. For example adding stuff to shopping list or setting up a reminder.4. Understands the Indian accent very well. Sometimes I am amazed by how well it picks up stuff.6. Kids love it. An added advantage is that they can take help for homework and talking to alexa also motivates them to talk in English

    Worst software!!! Not even 50% of answers were matched to my questions. Ask anything, it says I'm not sure about that. Not even songs are playing as per my command. After every song it stops. It's not going to the next one. For every command we need to say Alexa. Only advantage with this product is it have a great bass. Waste of money.I asked about today's news and it has the same answer - Sorry, I don't know about what you are asking.OK Google is far far far better than Alexa.Wanna share one funny moment with Alexa...I asked her to tell me about routers and switches and she started telling about sandwich... <U+0001F635>

    At first i was confused which one to buy-Google home mini or Echo dot.After considering few factors I decided to buy this echo dot 3rd gen.Pros:1)Sound quality and volume has improved a lot from previous gen.2)Alexa and Amazon services are more integrated with Indian market which the Google lacks.For example I can book uber cab,order food in zomato,order things from Amazon without even taking out my smartphone.3)It can used as a smart speaker,Bluetooth speaker and also it has 3.5 mm headphone jack.4)Amazon prime membership at Rs 999 per year is the most value for money subscription.You can stream in Amazon prime video,music from prime music,become an Amazon prime member,free kindle e books and many more.Google takes monthly Rs 99 for songs only.5)You can control smart lights and electronics from Philips,Xiaomi,Yeelight and other Alexa compatible devicesCons:1) Let me be honest,Alexa can never beat Google assistant,Never(That's why I gave 4 stars)2)It has to be kept plugged in all the time,not battery powered(same is the case with Google home)So if you are looking for a smarter assistant to interact with,Google home is your choice.For all other uses Amazon echo speakers are better.

    I got it on sale for 3k. For the price, it offers decent sound and richer bass, compared to my much cheaper, 1.5k Bluetooth speaker, the Boat Stone 260. It works seemlessly with my smart home devices, and the app is fantastic. It yet doesn't have support with fire TV stick, but Amazon assures it'll arrive by mid-november, so that's something to look out for. The app works great, and you can control your smart home or this dot from anywhere in the world, as long both of your devices have an internet connection. It's a fun little party trick, really. I couldn't be more happier with my echo dot. Also, as you can see in the picture, I got the sophisticated looking white color ;)Edit: It has fire TV support now, it's not the best experience, but hey - it WORKS.

    Rate of speech cannot be altered. Specially in bedtime stories. Children don't understand the fast English.Accent is pathetic.Kids can't understand the accent.It's a good music player but poor assistant.Many a times the MIC doesn work.The biggest problem is the search. criteria.  There is a lot of information which is on google that it deliberately does not pick.  It searches only from amazon search engine/wikipedia.

    This device does not have integration with Fire TV in INDIA ONLY !!.  So, if you don't have smart plug and smart switches then only thing you can do with this device is play music. not worth paying 3000 for getting voice command support for playing music only.
